# BedrockConnect on Docker

- Install `docker` and `docker-compose`
- Run `docker-compose up` (`docker-compose up -d` for detached mode)

NOTE: This setup only includes the BedrockConnect instance portion, and not currently the DNS server. You can set a DNS server up with the install-bind.sh script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/master/scripts/install-bind.sh (TODO: Seperate docker image for BIND setup)
